== Description ==

An easy to use, GDPR compliant, drag and drop contact form. There is nothing to configure, all you have to do is set up your email address and add the shortcode to your pages.

You can create multiple different contact forms with ease.

This contact form plugin comes with all the basic contact form features including basic form fields, captcha for spam protection, email notifications, auto responder and message store, you can see all your form submissions right inside your WordPress dashboard

The plugin has been built to make creating contact forms painless and easy. Certainly no need to be a developer to create simple but powerful contact forms. This is why thousands of website builders, designers, business users and power users chose Quick Contact forms!

But don’t just take my word for it. See what our users think:

> Rare a contact form plugin has it all – responsive and feature-packed simple to use! Couldn’t ask for more!<br>
> Chris Evans | Website Designer & SEO Consultant<br><br>
> Excellent – lots of options, but still easy to use<br>
> Thanks a lot for this plugin! It bridges a rather large gap between completely preconfigured form plugins that lack essential fields, and more complex plugins that are very difficult for beginners to figure out. The built-in preview of the form as you are building is very helpful, and it has a really nice range of field type options and style settings, which are named in a more user-friendly way than most. Also, the drag and drop works smoothly and easily without any funky bugginess.<br>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change the labels and captions? =
Go to your plugin list and scroll down until you see 'Quick Contact Form' and click on 'Settings'. Select the 'Form Settings', 'Error Messages' or 'Reply options' tabs. Change the settings and Save (quite important this last bit).

= What's the shortcode? =
[qcf]

= How do I change the colours? =
Go to the plugin settings page and click on styling

= Can I add more fields? =
No.

= Why not? =
Well OK yes you can add more fields if you want but you are going to have to fiddle about with the php files which needs a bit of care an attention. Everything you need to know is in the [wordpress codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin).

= It's all gone wrong! =
If it all goes wrong, just reinstall the plugin and start again.

= Does anybody read these things? =
I did, and so have you.  Maybe there will be more, who knows.
